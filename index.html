                <p class="lead mb-5">I'm Davy, an engineer passionate about building cloud-native software on AWS. I
                    have experience in mobile development using Native Android, Flutter, React-native, and backend
                    development with Python and Typescript. My expertise also includes DevOps practices like CI/CD
                    pipelines, automated testing, and performance monitoring.</p>
                <p class="lead mb-5">After completing an MBO in Network and System Administration at Zoomvliet College
                    Roosendaal from 2013 to 2017, I began my career managing network systems for an elder care company,
                    gaining valuable experience in IT infrastructure over two years.</p>
                <p class="lead mb-5">Eager to deepen my expertise, I pursued a Bachelor of Science in Computer
                    Engineering at Avans Hogeschool in Breda. During my studies, I
                    specialized in a cloud-native software minor focused on AWS and undertook a notable project
                    developing blockchain applications for the Openbaar Ministerie. Additionally, I completed an
                    internship at ihomer, where I developed a mobile healthcare app, applying my learning in a
                    real-world setting. I graduated cum laude, reflecting my commitment to my educational pursuits.</p>
                <p class="lead mb-5">After graduation, I began freelancing in full-stack, cloud, and mobile development.
                    This work allowed me to apply my skills on diverse projects worldwide, further expanding my
                    practical experience across different sectors.</p>
                <p class="lead mb-5">In December 2021, I joined Loyally as a Software Engineer, where I was involved in
                    full-stack development, including integrating CRM systems and migrating applications to Azure. My
                    role heavily utilized CI/CD pipelines and cloud technologies, preparing me for advanced technical
                    challenges. Currently, I work as a Cloud/DevOps Engineer at Essent, the Netherlands' largest energy
                    company, a role I have held since February 2024. Here, I am pivotal in deploying and managing
                    cloud-native solutions, ensuring our IT infrastructure is scalable and efficient. This position
                    represents the ongoing evolution of my career in technology, where I continually strive to leverage
                    and enhance my capabilities in a dynamic industry landscape.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-5">Freelance Projects</h2>
        <p class="lead mb-5">Beginning my freelancing journey in 2023, I have since developed a portfolio of diverse and innovative applications. My projects reflect my expertise in creating practical and user-friendly solutions. Here's a brief overview of some of the applications I've built:</p>

        <div class="freelance-project">
            <h3 class="mb-2">1. PRIME Mobile App:</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Created for Tower Capital, a leader in sourcing debt and equity placements from $3M to $300M with $3.5 billion arranged, the PRIME app helps index, photograph, and review potential properties. Developed in FlutterFlow for Android, it connects with an MS SQL Server for data management. Users can log in, select properties via dropdown or QR code, and submit reviews using speech-to-text. The app works offline, syncing data once online, and offers tabs for Property Selection, New Reviews, and Submission.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="freelance-project">
            <h3 class="mb-2">2. Position Size Calculator App:</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Developed upon a client's request, this app is designed for forex traders to calculate their risk in the forex market. Unlike the existing web-based solutions, this app offers a more convenient and accessible way to determine position sizes. Tailored to meet the specific needs of traders, it simplifies risk management by providing a user-friendly interface for calculating the appropriate position size based on account balance, risk percentage, and stop loss.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="freelance-project">
            <h3 class="mb-2">3. Deloitte Opiniepaal App:</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Originally a native Android application, this project involved converting it to a FlutterFlow app. Designed for use on Samsung Galaxy Tablets in kiosk mode, this app is placed in public areas for people to record their opinions on various topics. It integrates Whisper (OpenAI) for transcription and GPT-4 (OpenAI) to create summaries and quotes. The app features a start screen with a question prompt, a tutorial on how it works, a recording interface, a loading and thank you page, and a summary page that displays the GPT-generated summary and quote with an option to regenerate the quote. The final page presents a QR code for additional information.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="freelance-project">
            <h3 class="mb-2">4. Photo Backup Mobile App:</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">This React Native (Expo) app allows users to back up photos and videos to S3-compatible storage providers like AWS S3, Storj, and Wasabi. The app features multi-disk backup, encryption, and hashing functionalities. Key functionalities include connecting to storage disks, reading the device’s photo library, checking for previously uploaded photos via hashing, encrypting and uploading new photos, and generating encrypted previews. The user interface has three tabs: 'Disks' for managing storage disks, 'Uploads' for tracking ongoing uploads, and 'Browse' for viewing uploaded items in a grid format. This project required proficiency in TypeScript, understanding of OOP, and experience with AWS S3 and React Native.</p>

        <div class="freelance-project">
            <h3 class="mb-2">5. Basic FlutterFlow ChatGPT Whisper App:</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Created in FlutterFlow, this app is a straightforward yet innovative project that integrates with the ChatGPT API and Whisper. The app allows users to record a question using a record button, which then changes to a stop button during the recording. Once the recording is stopped, the app transcribes the audio and displays the text on the screen. This question is then sent to ChatGPT, and the response is received and spoken back to the user using Whisper. The response is also displayed in text form below a play button. The project was designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. A key feature of the app is its simplicity in design, focusing on the seamless integration of voice recording, transcription, and AI-powered responses. This app demonstrates my proficiency in FlutterFlow development and my ability to integrate advanced APIs like ChatGPT and Whisper, creating a responsive and interactive user experience.</p>
