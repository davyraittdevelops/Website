								<h2 class="major">Weather Station</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/picweerstation.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p></a>In period 1.1 of studying Computer Science we received the project "Avans Weather Station". Avans has a weather station on its roof, and its was our job to communicate with this weather station.
								In this communication we requested multiple values, like outside temperature, inside temperature, and rain %. With these value we calculated information. An example could be: How many heatwaves did 2017 had?

								<h2 class="major">BoeBot</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/picboebot.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p></a>In period 1.2 of studying Computer Science we received the project "BoeBot". In this project we were assigned to make a AGV (Automated guided vehicle). Notable parts of the application:
								For example: The BoeBot was able to follow a black line using color sensors. You were also able to manually control it.
								The BoeBot automatically came to a stop when facing a object in the front or in the back (using ultrasonic waves).
									The Boebot had an adjustable speed. And the BoeBot was controllable trough ethernet cable, remote (infrared), and bluetooth. <a href="https://youtu.be/ONvYLrFC24Y">You can check out a demo movie with this link.</a></p> </p>

								<h2 class="major">2D Game - Niciarex</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic2dgame.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p></a>In period 1.3 of studying Computer Science we were teached the course: "2D Graphics".
									For this course I had to make a 2D application. My 2D game was built completely from scratch and each tile and player tile was "hand made".
									Functions: Update/draw code, FPS Counter, usage of images/sprites, different worlds including a randomly generated one, different gamestates (menu, pause, game).
									Keyboard input with WASD and arrows. Object collision. Camera follows the player. Animations, combat, and music. <a href="https://youtu.be/2ivG6JrLKKY">

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/picfestivalplanner1.png" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/picfestivalplanner2.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p></a>In period 1.3 of studying Computer Science we were assigned the project "Festival Planner". The purpose was to make an application where you can plan festivals, in this application
									we will predict where the crowd will go based on popularity of the artist. Notable parts of the application: A*-algorithm for pathfinding. Able to pause and fast forwards the simulation.
									Login with a working SQL database.

								<h2 class="major">Networking Checkers</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/checkers.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p></a> In period 1.4 of studying Computer Science we were assigned to create a multiplayer app.
									We decided it would be fun to recreate checkers.
									Notable parts of the application: Multiplayer, chatting. Client server application.

								<h2 class="major">Theme Park</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/picpretpark.png" alt=""  width="10" height="700"/></span>
								<p></a>In period 1.4 we got the project "Theme park". We had to choose a specific target group. Our group was seniors.
									We were asked to develop an application specifically for this group. The application had to include sensors and actuators.
									We used 7-segment dispalys, ultasonic sensors, and a servomotor to create this app. Notable parts of the application:
									Calculates waiting times based on how many people are in line, first person view of a roller coaster.
									See where nearby benches are, and if they are available.

								<h2 class="major">Spooky Bird</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/picspookybird.png" alt="" width="10" height="700" /></span>
								<p></a>In my free time i decided it was an interesting project to create an android game. This would give me experience with creating a game on Android,
									but also uploading it to the Play Store. Spooky Bird is a simple game where you can score points for staying alive and navigating between the tubes.
									Notable parts of the application: Peristent high score saving with shared preferences, object collision.

								<h2 class="major">CV Mario</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/piccvgame.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p></a>In my free time i decided it was an interesting project to create an CV android game. This was insprired by various games I saw on linkedin.
									The map was made with Tiled. The game was made with the library LibGDX. Game includes object collision, defeatable monsters, and music.

								<h2 class="major">Fitness App</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/picfitnessapp.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p></a> In period 2.1 of studying Computer Science we got the course "Programming in C#". We had to create an network server/client app of our choice.
									I love fitness and use the app MyFitnessPal everyday. I decided it would be a fun project to try and recreate this app.
									Notable parts of the application: SQL Database connection running on Virtualbox. Encrypting the login details.
									Using Rest and an API to collect food information. Server/Client application.

									<a href="https://youtu.be/Q8m9pNqrRB8">You can check out a demo movie with this link.</a></p>

								<h2 class="major">Spotify Downloader </h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/picspotifydownloader.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p></a>I use Spotify daily. I realised it would be a shame if one day I would lose all my playlists. Thats why I decided
									to write an application that lets me download all Spotify songs locally.
									Notable parts of the application: Scraping http to get playlist data, downloading the first result of youtube,
									converting .webm to mp3 using FFMPEG. Error checking (checking if the file already exists, checking for hidden symbols, checking if the song we download is not too long).

								<h2 class="major">Remote Healthcare </h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/picremotehealthcare.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p></a>In period 2.1 of studying Computer Science we received the project "Remote Healthcare".
									We had to create a hometraining app, in which you can also bike in Virtual Reality.
									The hometrainer communicates trough Bluetooth.
									Notable parts of the application: Using a Virtual Reality engine trough a tunnel to the local engine. Customizing this virtual reality scene.
									Server/client app with a login. Network encryption. Showing heartrate/speed trough graphs. Storing data of clients biking.
									Communcating to clients in this VR scene.
