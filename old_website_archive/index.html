                system administration, focusing on configuring, managing, and
                troubleshooting network infrastructure. Key topics included
                network protocols, server management, security practices, and
                user support. Practical experience was gained in setting up and
                managing local area networks (LAN), wide area networks (WAN),
                and wireless networks, as well as working with various operating
                systems and virtualization technologies.

              In this blog, I show how I built a custom “Study Buddy” app in Flutter to
              help me learn AWS content on the go. You will see how I track scores,
              display explanations, and even allow “Endless Mode” for long study sessions.

            Beginning my freelancing journey in 2023, I have since developed a
            portfolio of diverse and innovative applications. My projects
            reflect my expertise in creating practical and user-friendly
            solutions. Here's a brief overview of some of the applications I've
            built:
          </p>

          <div class="freelance-project">
            <h3 class="mb-2">PRIME Mobile App:</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Created for a financial services company specializing in commercial real estate
              financing, the PRIME
              app helps index, photograph, and review potential properties.
              Developed in FlutterFlow for Android, it connects with an MS SQL
              Server for data management. Users can log in, select properties
              via dropdown or QR code, and submit reviews using speech-to-text.
              The app works offline, syncing data once online, and offers tabs
              for Property Selection, New Reviews, and Submission.

            <h3 class="mb-2">Position Size Calculator App:</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Developed upon a client's request, this app is designed for forex
              traders to calculate their risk in the forex market. Unlike the
              existing web-based solutions, this app offers a more convenient
              and accessible way to determine position sizes. Tailored to meet
              the specific needs of traders, it simplifies risk management by
              providing a user-friendly interface for calculating the
              appropriate position size based on account balance, risk
              percentage, and stop loss.

              Originally a native Android application, this project involved
              converting it to a FlutterFlow app. Designed for use on Samsung
              Galaxy Tablets in kiosk mode, this app is placed in public areas
              for people to record their opinions on various topics. It
              integrates AI transcription services and large language models
              to create summaries and quotes. The app features a start screen
              with a question prompt, a tutorial on how it works, a recording
              interface, a loading and thank you page, and a summary page that
              displays the GPT-generated summary and quote with an option to
              regenerate the quote. The final page presents a QR code for
              additional information.

            <h3 class="mb-2">Photo Backup Mobile App:</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
              This React Native (Expo) app allows users to back up photos and
              videos to S3-compatible storage providers like AWS S3, Storj, and
              Wasabi. The app features multi-disk backup, encryption, and
              hashing functionalities. Key functionalities include connecting to
              storage disks, reading the device’s photo library, checking for
              previously uploaded photos via hashing, encrypting and uploading
              new photos, and generating encrypted previews. The user interface
              has three tabs: 'Disks' for managing storage disks, 'Uploads' for
              tracking ongoing uploads, and 'Browse' for viewing uploaded items
              in a grid format. This project required proficiency in TypeScript,
              understanding of OOP, and experience with AWS S3 and React Native.

            <h3 class="mb-2">FlutterFlow ChatGPT Whisper App:</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Created in FlutterFlow, this app is a straightforward yet
              innovative project that integrates with the ChatGPT API and
              Whisper. The app allows users to record a question using a record
              button, which then changes to a stop button during the recording.
              Once the recording is stopped, the app transcribes the audio and
              displays the text on the screen. This question is then sent to
              ChatGPT, and the response is received and spoken back to the user
              using Whisper. The response is also displayed in text form below a
              play button. The project was designed to be user-friendly and
              intuitive. A key feature of the app is its simplicity in design,
              focusing on the seamless integration of voice recording,
              transcription, and AI-powered responses. This app demonstrates my
              proficiency in FlutterFlow development and my ability to integrate
              advanced APIs like ChatGPT and Whisper, creating a responsive and
              interactive user experience.

              The ecosystem consists of a WordPress-based subscription website,
              an Angular admin dashboard, and a React Native mobile app.
              Trainers can create and manage workout programs through the
              dashboard, while clients use the mobile app to access workouts,
              track progress, and interact with trainers. The platform features
              real-time progress tracking, workout resumption capabilities, and
              integrated chat functionality. Key technical achievements include
              implementing complex many-to-many relationships for workout
              management, continuous data synchronization for uninterrupted user
              experience, and seamless integration between the web and mobile
