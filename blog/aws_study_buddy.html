    <h1>Building an AWS Study Buddy App in Flutter</h1>
    <p class="blog-metadata">By Davy Raitt, November 2024</p>

    <p>
        I needed a quick way to review multiple-choice questions for AWS certifications without fussing
        with spreadsheets or random websites. So I built a Flutter quiz app—complete with local data
        storage, real-time score updates, and an “Endless Mode” challenge. Here’s how it came together,
        along with some of the issues I faced while building it.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. Why This App?</h2>
    <p>
        I wanted something that would:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Load new or updated questions quickly from a simple JSON file.</li>
        <li>Keep track of how many questions I’ve answered (and how many are correct!), motivating me
            to keep going.</li>
        <li>Let me study on the go without requiring a constant network connection.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Originally, I tried making a simple command-line script, but quickly realized
        a mobile-friendly interface would be far more enjoyable for daily use.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>2. Data Handling & Local Storage</h2>
    <p>
        One key feature is using <code>SharedPreferences</code> for high scores and total questions answered.
        A short snippet:
    </p>

    <pre><code>
// Data snippet (under 10 lines)
Future<void> loadHighScore() async {
  final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  setState(() {
    highScore = prefs.getInt('highScore') ?? 0;
  });
  print("Loaded highScore: $highScore");
}
</code></pre>

    <p>
        <strong>Explanation:</strong> This function reads the saved high score from the device.
        It’s simple but crucial for motivation—I can see my personal best even if I exit the app.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>3. The Quiz Logic</h2>
    <p>
        My quiz logic reads JSON questions, shuffles them, and then tallies a score.
        Here’s a small peek at the function that checks if you got an answer correct:
    </p>

    <pre><code>
// Checking correctness (under 10 lines)
bool isAnswerCorrect(List<String> correct, List<String> chosen) {
  final correctSet = Set<String>.from(correct);
  final chosenSet  = Set<String>.from(chosen);
  return correctSet.containsAll(chosenSet)
         && chosenSet.containsAll(correctSet);
}
</code></pre>

    <p>
        <strong>Explanation:</strong> We convert answers to sets and compare them,
        so multi-answer questions can be handled easily (e.g., “A and C”).
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>4. Explanation Popups</h2>
    <p>
        Each time I submit an answer, I show an explanation dialog. If I missed the question,
        this helps me learn faster.
    </p>

    <pre><code>
// Simple dialog snippet (under 10 lines)
showDialog(
  context: context,
  builder: (_) => AlertDialog(
    title: const Text("Explanation"),
    content: Text(currentQuestion.explanation),
    actions: [
      TextButton(
        onPressed: () => Navigator.pop(context),
        child: const Text("OK"),
      )
    ],
  )
);
</code></pre>

    <p>
        <strong>Explanation:</strong> The snippet uses <code>showDialog</code> to
        pop up a small explanation, then closes on “OK.”
        This is how I reinforce knowledge on each step.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>5. “Endless Mode” Twist</h2>
    <p>
        Sometimes I want a quick session. Other times, I want to keep going
        until I’m totally done or get a question wrong. Here’s the snippet
        that triggers “endless” behavior if you enable it:
    </p>

    <pre><code>
// Endless mode (under 10 lines)
if (!isCorrect && widget.endlessMode) {
  // If you get it wrong once, the quiz ends
  showExplanationAndEndQuiz();
  return;
}
</code></pre>

    <p>
        <strong>Explanation:</strong> If you choose <em>Endless Mode</em>, messing up any question
        ends the quiz. It’s an extra challenge for me when I’m feeling confident and
        want a “sudden death” approach to studying.
    </p>

    <h2>Challenges & Lessons Learned</h2>
    <p>
        One big challenge was making sure the UI stayed smooth when switching
        between different question sets. I had to shuffle questions properly
        without repeating them, and also prevent data corruption if a user
        closed the app mid-quiz.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another lesson learned was balancing the right amount of detail in
        each question’s explanation. Too short, and I didn’t learn enough.
        Too long, and I’d gloss over it. Striking that balance was key.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Wrap-Up</h2>
    <p>
        This app turned out to be a great companion for my AWS cert prep.
        With offline-ready quizzes, trackable high scores, and the variety
        of short or endless modes, it kept me engaged and let me see
        my progress clearly. Hopefully, it inspires you to build (and
        personalize) your own quiz-based study buddy!

        By now I have passed 4 certifications with it!
