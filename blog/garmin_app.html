            <h4>The Challenge: When Your Fitness App Needs a Boost</h4>
            <p>As a software developer with a passion for fitness, I've always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and personal health. Like many people, I struggle with consistency in my fitness routine. I have a Garmin watch that tracks my activities, but I found the standard app lacking in motivation and goal-setting features. I needed something more engaging and personalized.</p>

            <h4>The Solution: A Custom Garmin Data Tracker</h4>
            <p>To address this, I decided to create my own fitness tracking app. Here's how I approached it:</p>

            <h5>Backend (AWS Lambda) - The Data Processing Engine</h5>
            <p>I created a Python Lambda function that connects to the Garmin API using the garth library. Here's a snippet of how it fetches and processes activities:</p>

            <pre><code lang="python">
def fetch_and_process_activities(start_date, end_date):
    print(f'Fetching activities from {start_date} to {end_date}')
    activities = garth.connectapi(
        "/activitylist-service/activities/search/activities",
        params={"startDate": start_date, "endDate": end_date}
    )
    
    total_km = 0
    for activity in activities:
        activity_type = activity['activityType']['typeKey']
        if activity_type in ['walking', 'running', 'treadmill_running', 'hiking']:
            distance_km = activity['distance'] / 1000  # Convert meters to kilometers
            total_km += distance_km
            print(f"Added {distance_km:.2f} km from {activity_type} activity on {activity['startTimeLocal']}.")
    
    print(f"Total distance for specified range: {total_km:.2f} km.")
    return total_km
            </code></pre>

            <p>This function fetches activities for a given date range and calculates the total distance for walking, running, and hiking activities.</p>

            <h5>Frontend (Flutter) - Visualizing Progress</h5>
            <p>I built a Flutter app that communicates with my AWS backend to display my Garmin data. One of the key features is a chart showing my monthly activity. Here's a snippet of how I created this chart:</p>

            <pre><code lang="dart">
class KilometersChart extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<KmData> data;

  const KilometersChart(this.data, {Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return AspectRatio(
      aspectRatio: 1.7,
      child: BarChart(
        BarChartData(
          alignment: BarChartAlignment.spaceAround,
          maxY: data.map((e) => e.km).reduce((a, b) => a > b ? a : b) * 1.2,
          barTouchData: BarTouchData(
            touchTooltipData: BarTouchTooltipData(
              getTooltipItem: (group, groupIndex, rod, rodIndex) {
                return BarTooltipItem(
                  '${data[groupIndex].month}\n',
                  TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
                  children: <TextSpan>[
                    TextSpan(
                      text: '${rod.toY.toStringAsFixed(1)} km',
                      style: const TextStyle(
                        color: Colors.yellow,
                        fontSize: 16,
                        fontWeight: FontWeight.w500,
                      ),
                    ),
                  ],
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
          titlesData: FlTitlesData(
            // ... (title configuration)
          ),
          borderData: FlBorderData(show: false),
          barGroups: data.asMap().entries.map((entry) {
            return BarChartGroupData(
              x: entry.key,
              barRods: [
                BarChartRodData(
                  toY: entry.value.km,
                  color: Theme.of(context).primaryColor,
                  width: 22,
                  borderRadius: const BorderRadius.only(
                    topLeft: Radius.circular(6),
                    topRight: Radius.circular(6),
                  ),
                ),
              ],
            );
          }).toList(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
            </code></pre>

            <p>This chart provides a clear visual representation of my monthly kilometers, helping me track my progress over time.</p>

            <h4>Key Features</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Yearly Goal Tracking:</strong> I set an ambitious goal of 1000km per year, which includes hiking, walking, treadmill, and running activities. The app helps me visualize my progress towards this annual target.</li>
                <li><strong>Weekly Streak System:</strong> To keep myself consistently active, I implemented a streak system. Each week, I aim to reach a distance goal. If I succeed, the goal increases by 10% for the next week. If I miss the target, it resets to my original 15km goal. This gamification adds an extra layer of motivation to my routine.</li>
                <li><strong>Monthly Activity Visualization:</strong> The bar chart gives me a quick overview of my monthly performance, making it easy to spot trends and areas for improvement.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>The Impact: Progress in Motion</h4>
            <p>Since implementing this system, I've noticed several positive changes:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Increased Awareness:</strong> I'm now more conscious of my activity levels on a daily and weekly basis.</li>
                <li><strong>Goal-Oriented Mindset:</strong> The yearly and weekly goals give me clear targets to work towards, helping me stay focused on my fitness journey.</li>
                <li><strong>Motivation Boost:</strong> Seeing my progress visually represented is incredibly motivating, especially on days when I'm tempted to skip a workout.</li>
                <li><strong>Data-Driven Decisions:</strong> I can now make more informed decisions about my training based on trends in my data.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Technical Challenges and Learnings</h4>
            <p>Building this project wasn't without its challenges. Some key learnings include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>API Integration:</strong> Garmin doesn't provide public API access, so I had to use the garth library as a workaround. This required some creative problem-solving.</li>
                <li><strong>Activity Type Categorization:</strong> Garmin offers a wide variety of activity types. Deciding which ones to include in my distance calculations and how to categorize them took some consideration.</li>
                <li><strong>Time-Based Calculations:</strong> Calculating yearly and monthly totals was more complex than initially expected, especially when dealing with different time zones and date boundaries.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Fetching Limitations:</strong> Due to API constraints, I couldn't fetch a full year of data at once. I had to implement a pagination system to retrieve data in smaller chunks.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Future Enhancements</h4>
            <p>While the current version of my Garmin data tracker is functional, I have several ideas for future improvements:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Implement machine learning to predict future performance based on past data.</li>
                <li>Add social features to compare progress with friends, adding a friendly competitive element.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Conclusion: A Step in the Right Direction</h4>
            <p>Building this Garmin data tracker has been an exciting journey that combines my love for coding with my passion for fitness. It's a testament to how personal projects can not only improve our technical skills but also positively impact our daily lives.</p>
            <p>While it hasn't transformed me into a fitness guru overnight, it has certainly helped me move more consistently. The app provides the extra motivation I need to lace up my running shoes, even on days when the couch looks particularly inviting.</p>
            <p>Remember, the key to achieving fitness goals often lies in consistency, awareness, and finding what works for you. Whether you build your own tracker or use existing tools, find a way to keep your goals visible and measure your progress. After all, every step counts!</p>
