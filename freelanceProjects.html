            <p>Beginning my freelancing journey in 2023, I have since developed a portfolio of diverse and innovative
                applications. My projects reflect my expertise in creating practical and user-friendly solutions. Here's
                a brief overview of some of the applications I've built:

            <h2 class="freelancingProject1Heading">1. Position Size Calculator App: </h2>
            <p class="freelancingProjectDetails">Developed upon a client's request, this app is designed for forex
                traders to calculate their risk in the forex market. Unlike the existing web-based solutions, this app
                offers a more convenient and accessible way to determine position sizes. Tailored to meet the specific
                needs of traders, it simplifies risk management by providing a user-friendly interface for calculating
                the appropriate position size based on account balance, risk percentage, and stop loss.

            <h2 class="freelancingProject2Heading">2.Deloitte Opiniepaal App: </h2>
            <p class="freelancingProject2Details">Originally a native Android application, this project involved
                converting it to a Flutterflow app. Designed for use on Samsung Galaxy Tablets in kiosk mode, this app
                is placed in public areas for people to record their opinions on various topics. It integrates Whisper
                (OpenAI) for transcription and GPT-4 (OpenAI) to create summaries and quotes. The app features a start
                screen with a question prompt, a tutorial on how it works, a recording interface, a loading and thank
                you page, and a summary page that displays the GPT-generated summary and quote with an option to
                regenerate the quote. The final page presents a QR code for additional information.

            <h2 class="freelancingProject3Heading">3.Photo Backup Mobile App: </h2>
            <p class="freelancingProject3Details">This React Native (Expo) app allows users to back up photos and videos
                to S3-compatible storage providers like AWS S3, Storj, and Wasabi. The app features multi-disk backup,
                encryption, and hashing functionalities. Key functionalities include connecting to storage disks,
                reading the device’s photo library, checking for previously uploaded photos via hashing, encrypting and
                uploading new photos, and generating encrypted previews. The user interface has three tabs: 'Disks' for
                managing storage disks, 'Uploads' for tracking ongoing uploads, and 'Browse' for viewing uploaded items
                in a grid format. This project required proficiency in TypeScript, understanding of OOP, and experience
                with AWS S3 and React Native.

        <div class="freelancingProject4">
            <h2 class="freelancingProject4Heading">4.Basic FlutterFlow ChatGPT Whisper App: </h2>
            <p class="freelancingProject4Details">Created in Flutter Flow, this app is a straightforward yet innovative
                project that integrates with the ChatGPT API and Whisper. The app allows users to record a question
                using a record button, which then changes to a stop button during the recording. Once the recording is
                stopped, the app transcribes the audio and displays the text on the screen. This question is then sent
                to ChatGPT, and the response is received and spoken back to the user using Whisper. The response is also
                displayed in text form below a play button. The project was designed to be user-friendly and intuitive.
                A key feature of the app is its simplicity in design, focusing on the seamless integration of voice
                recording, transcription, and AI-powered responses. This app demonstrates my proficiency in Flutter Flow
                development and my ability to integrate advanced APIs like ChatGPT and Whisper, creating a responsive
                and interactive user experience.

            <h2 class="freelancingProject5Heading">5.PRIME Mobile App: </h2>
            <p class="freelancingProject5Details">This app, named “PRIME”, is designed for users to conduct drive-by
                reviews of selected properties. Developed in Flutter Flow for Android, it interacts with an MS SQL
                Server database for data retrieval and posting. Key functionalities include user login, property
                selection via dropdown or QR code scanning, and a review form for entering various ratings and comments
                with speech-to-text capabilities. The app is tailored for offline functionality, with data
                synchronization occurring when internet connectivity is available. It also features forms for creating
                new reviews and viewing completed ones, with the ability to refresh data and submit reviews to the SQL
                server. The app's user interface is organized with tabs for Property Selection, New Property Review, and
                data submission.
